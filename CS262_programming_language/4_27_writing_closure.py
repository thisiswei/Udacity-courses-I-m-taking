# Writing Closure

# We are currently looking at chart[i] and we see x => ab . cd from j

# Write the Python procedure, closure, that takes five parameters:

#   grammar: the grammar using the previously described structure
#   i: a number representing the chart state that we are currently looking at
#   x: a single nonterminal
#   ab and cd: lists of many things

# The closure function should return all the new parsing states that we want to
# add to chart position i

# Hint: This is tricky. If you are stuck, do a list comphrension over the grammar rules.

def closure (grammar, i, x, ab, cd):
    return [(x, [], G[1], i) 
            for G in grammar 
            if cd != '' and cd[0] == G[0]]


grammar = [ 
    ("exp", ["exp", "+", "exp"]),
    ("exp", ["exp", "-", "exp"]),
    ("exp", ["(", "exp", ")"]),
    ("exp", ["num"]),
    ("t",["I","like","t"]),
    ("t",[""])
    ]

# Writing Shift

# We are currently looking at chart[i] and we see x => ab . cd from j. The input is tokens.

# Your procedure, shift, should either return None, at which point there is
# nothing to do or will return a single new parsing state that presumably
# involved shifting over the c if c matches the ith token.

def shift (tokens, i, x, ab, cd, j):
    # Insert code here
    if cd <> [] and tokens[i] == cd[0]:
        return (x, ab+cd[0], cd[1:], j)
    else:
        return None

# Writing Reductions

# We are looking at chart[i] and we see x => ab . cd from j.

# Hint: Reductions are tricky, so as a hint, remember that you only want to do
# reductions if cd == []

# Hint: You'll have to look back previously in the chart. 

def reductions(chart, i, x, ab, cd, j): 
    # Insert code here!
     return [(jstate[0], jstate[1]+[x], jstate[2][1:], jstate[3])
             for jstate in chart[j]
             if cd == [] and jstate[2] != [] and jstate[2][0] == x]
